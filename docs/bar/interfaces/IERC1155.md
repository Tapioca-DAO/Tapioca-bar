### isApprovedForAll

```solidity
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool)
```

Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _owner | address | The owner of the tokens |
| _operator | address | Address of authorized operator |

#### Returns

### safeBatchTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] _ids, uint256[] _values, bytes _data) external nonpayable
```

Transfers `_values` amount(s) of `_ids` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).

*Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see &quot;Approval&quot; section of the standard). MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address. MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`. MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient. MUST revert on any other error.         MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see &quot;Safe Transfer Rules&quot; section of the standard). Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc). After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size &gt; 0). If so, it MUST call the relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` and act appropriately (see &quot;Safe Transfer Rules&quot; section of the standard).                      *

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _from | address | Source address |
| _to | address | Target address |
| _ids | uint256[] | IDs of each token type (order and length must match _values array) |
| _values | uint256[] | Transfer amounts per token type (order and length must match _ids array) |
| _data | bytes | Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` |

### safeTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes _data) external nonpayable
```

Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).

*Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see &quot;Approval&quot; section of the standard). MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address. MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent. MUST revert on any other error. MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see &quot;Safe Transfer Rules&quot; section of the standard). After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size &gt; 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see &quot;Safe Transfer Rules&quot; section of the standard).        *

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _from | address | Source address |
| _to | address | Target address |
| _id | uint256 | ID of the token type |
| _value | uint256 | Transfer amount |
| _data | bytes | Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to `onERC1155Received` on `_to` |

### setApprovalForAll

```solidity
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external nonpayable
```

Enable or disable approval for a third party (&quot;operator&quot;) to manage all of the caller&#39;s tokens.

*MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _operator | address | Address to add to the set of authorized operators |
| _approved | bool | True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval |



## Events

### ApprovalForAll

```solidity
event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved)
```



*MUST emit when approval for a second party/operator address to manage all tokens for an owner address is enabled or disabled (absence of an event assumes disabled).        *

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _owner `indexed` | address | undefined |
| _operator `indexed` | address | undefined |
| _approved  | bool | undefined |

### TransferBatch

```solidity
event TransferBatch(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256[] _ids, uint256[] _values)
```



*Either `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` MUST emit when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers as well as minting or burning (see &quot;Safe Transfer Rules&quot; section of the standard).       The `_operator` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender). The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. The `_to` argument MUST be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The `_ids` argument MUST be the list of tokens being transferred. The `_values` argument MUST be the list of number of tokens (matching the list and order of tokens specified in _ids) the holder balance is decreased by and match what the recipient balance is increased by. When minting/creating tokens, the `_from` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address). When burning/destroying tokens, the `_to` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address).                *

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _operator `indexed` | address | undefined |
| _from `indexed` | address | undefined |
| _to `indexed` | address | undefined |
| _ids  | uint256[] | undefined |
| _values  | uint256[] | undefined |

### TransferSingle

```solidity
event TransferSingle(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value)
```



*Either `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` MUST emit when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers as well as minting or burning (see &quot;Safe Transfer Rules&quot; section of the standard). The `_operator` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender). The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased. The `_to` argument MUST be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased. The `_id` argument MUST be the token type being transferred. The `_value` argument MUST be the number of tokens the holder balance is decreased by and match what the recipient balance is increased by. When minting/creating tokens, the `_from` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address). When burning/destroying tokens, the `_to` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address).        *

| _value  | uint256 | undefined |

### URI

```solidity
event URI(string _value, uint256 indexed _id)

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _value  | string | undefined |
